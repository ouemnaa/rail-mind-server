You are an expert railway operations judge. Input: a conflict and a list of normalized candidate resolutions from two agents. 

TASK: Rank the candidate resolutions and produce JSON only, matching exactly the structure below for each ranked item (do not change field names):

Each ranked item must include:
- rank (int)
- resolution_number (int, 1-indexed position in input list)
- resolution_id (string)
- bullet_resolution_actions: { "actions": [ strings ] }
- overall_score (numerical 0-100)
- safety_rating, efficiency_rating, feasibility_rating, robustness_rating (numbers 0-10)
- justification (short paragraph, max 2 sentences)
- full_resolution: the complete resolution object including resolution_id, source_agent, strategy_name, actions, expected_outcome, reasoning, safety_score, efficiency_score, feasibility_score, overall_fitness, estimated_delay_min, affected_trains, side_effects, algorithm_type, raw_data

**CONFLICT CONTEXT:**
- Type: headway at MILANO CENTRALE, PAVIA
- Location: MILANO CENTRALE--PAVIA
- Affected Trains: REG_001, FR_002

**EVALUATION CRITERIA (Equal Weight):**
1. Safety (30%): Maintains operational safety, prevents cascading failures
2. Efficiency (30%): Reduces delays, restores normal operations
3. Feasibility (25%): Quick implementation with available infrastructure
4. Robustness (15%): Handles uncertainty and side effects

**IMPORTANT:**
- Mathematical optimization solutions are AS VALID as hybrid/historical approaches
- Lower delay metrics indicate BETTER performance
- Judge based on OBJECTIVE CRITERIA

**RESOLUTIONS TO EVALUATE:**


### Resolution 1: Immediate Caution and Speed Reduction
**Source:** Agent 1 (Hybrid/Historical)
**Algorithm Type:** algorithm

**Actions:**
  1. Issue immediate caution to REG_001 driver
  2. Reduce REG_001 speed to 60 km/h
  3. Extend separation by holding at next signal (PAVIA)

**Expected Outcome:** Restore safe headway between REG_001 and FR_002
**Reasoning:** Headway violations risk rear-end collisions. Immediate speed reduction creates a safety buffer.

**Metrics:**
- Overall Fitness: 0.845
- Safety: 0.800
- Efficiency: 0.700
- Feasibility: 0.900
- Estimated Delay: 2.0 min

**Side Effects:** None

### Resolution 2: Priority-based Rescheduling
**Source:** Agent 1 (Hybrid/Historical)
**Algorithm Type:** algorithm

**Actions:**
  1. Adjust train schedules to enforce minimum headway time
  2. Delay subsequent trains if necessary
  3. Investigate cause of headway violation

**Expected Outcome:** Prevent headway violations and ensure safe separation between trains
**Reasoning:** Headway rules ensure safe braking distance between trains. Violations risk rear-end collisions.

**Metrics:**
- Overall Fitness: 0.815
- Safety: 0.800
- Efficiency: 0.700
- Feasibility: 0.850
- Estimated Delay: 3.0 min

**Side Effects:** None

### Resolution 3: Hybrid Headway Management
**Source:** Agent 1 (Hybrid/Historical)
**Algorithm Type:** hybrid

**Actions:**
  1. Issue caution to REG_001 driver and reduce speed to 70 km/h
  2. Adjust train schedules to enforce minimum headway time
  3. Re-route FR_002 to an adjacent track if feasible
  4. Delay subsequent lower-priority trains if necessary

**Expected Outcome:** Resolve headway conflict while minimizing delays
**Reasoning:** Combines immediate caution and speed reduction with priority-based rescheduling, leveraging insights from historical cases to optimize traffic flow

**Metrics:**
- Overall Fitness: 0.810
- Safety: 0.750
- Efficiency: 0.750
- Feasibility: 0.850
- Estimated Delay: 5.0 min

**Side Effects:** Potential minor delays to subsequent trains, Increased workload for dispatchers

### Resolution 4: Fast Constructive Heuristic
**Source:** Agent 2 (Mathematical Solver)
**Algorithm Type:** optimization_greedy

**Actions:**
  1. Hold FR_002 for 2.5 minutes
  2. Speed up REG_001 by 10%

**Expected Outcome:** Reduces total system delay to 0.0 minutes (improvement of 0.0% from baseline). Resolves headway violation through coordinated speed adjustments while maintaining safety constraints and operational feasibility. Affects 0 passengers with minimal service disruption.
**Reasoning:** Fast constructive heuristic making locally optimal decisions at each step. Low computational overhead enables real-time deployment while maintaining acceptable solution quality. Particularly effective when immediate response is critical and solution space is well-structured. Achieves 100.0% recovery smoothness, minimizing operational disruption and maintaining schedule integrity. Implements 2 coordinated action(s) with verified constraint satisfaction and operational feasibility.

**Metrics:**
- Overall Fitness: 1.000
- Safety: 0.900
- Efficiency: 0.500
- Feasibility: 0.850
- Estimated Delay: 0.0 min

**Side Effects:** Minimal cascading effects (isolated resolution), Simple implementation with minimal coordination overhead
